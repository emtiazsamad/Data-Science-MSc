# Data-Science-MSc
A repository containing coursework and labs completed during my Masters in Data Science.

## Research Project (MSc Thesis)
This folder contains my research project on improving on model-free algorithms in deep reinforcement learning. In this project I take a former SOTA algorithm called R2D2, and make novel contributions in increasing the depth of the model and adding dense (skip) connections. This successfully improved the RL agent by increasing sample efficiency.

## Machine Learning 1
This folder contains some of the fundamental ML algorithms such as decision trees and regression implemented from scratch.
The coursework in this module focuses on:
- Data Exploration
- Decision Trees
- Linear Regression
- Belief Propogation

## Machine Learning 2
This folder contains an Image Classifier built using a deep neural network, and Sentiment Analysis text classifier which was built using both SVM and boosting methods.

## Reinforcement Learning
The coursework component of this module focuses on implementing different RL algorithms such as On-Policy MC Control, SARSA and Q-Learning in a racetrack environment. This module also consisted of a group project, in which we decided to solve the Lunar Lander problem and compared the performance of DDQN, PPO and REINFORCE algorithms.

## Bayesian Machine Learning
This module consisted of two lab components and a group project. The labs covered the implementation of bayesian linear regression and MC sampling in bayesian regression, wheras the project focused on the remainder of the fundamental topics covered in the module, namely:
- Variational Inference
- Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo applied to simple, multivariate Gaussian and Regression
- Gaussian Processes

## Software Technologies for Data Science
This folder contains work which purely focuses on Python and SQL programming. SQLite was used in the project component for a task which required us to create a backend for a user interface to store data in a database. The functionality of the app (traffic counter) was coded using Python. The folder also consists of other labs which required knowledge of fundamental programming skills such as data structures and OOP.

## Applied Data Science (1 & 2)
The work contained in this folder focuses more heavily on data extraction, analysis and visualisation skills as well as producing quality infographics and reports. The folder also contains a project on estimating the increased electricity demands due to the emergence of electric vehicles.
