## 🧠 MSc Thesis — Research Project
**Title:** _Improving Model-Free Algorithms in Deep Reinforcement Learning_

In this project, I extended the former state-of-the-art **R2D2 algorithm** by:
- Increasing the **network depth**
- Incorporating **dense (skip) connections**

✅ **Outcome:** Improved sample efficiency and performance of the RL agent in complex environments.
